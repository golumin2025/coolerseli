      faqs:
        - question: Bedding, Clothing, Curtains, Drapes and Linens
          answer: >
            Fabric items like clothing, curtains and drapes are best if stored
            on hangers. If hanging cartons are not available, such items should
            be carefully folded and stored in dresser drawers or cedar chests
            along with bedding and linens.
        - question: Appliances
          answer: >
            A refrigerator or freezer should be thoroughly dry and stored with
            its door slightly ajar. Some goods can be stored inside large
            appliances. Be sure to make a note if you place anything inside.
            Boxes can be stacked on top of stoves, refrigerators, and freezers.
            Make sure that stoves and cooking equipment are clean and dry before
            you pack them.
        - question: Dishes and Glassware
          answer: >
            Place a layer of packing inside the bottom and the top of boxes
            containing glassware. All glass items should be individually
            wrapped: nest cups and bowls together and stand plates, saucers, and
            platters on their edge. Wrapped glasses should be placed near the
            top of cartons. Again, fill all open pockets with packing paper.
            Label all boxes containing glassware and do not place heavy items on
            top.
        - question: Furniture
          answer: >
            Place a pallet, corrugated cardboard mat, or plastic sheet on the
            floor before placing furniture. If possible, stand sofas and
            mattresses on end. Disassemble beds and tables and wrap table legs
            in paper. If a table will not disassemble, place padding on the
            floor and place the table on its top with the legs pointing up. Use
            dresser tops for stacking cartons and dresser drawers for linens or
            small, delicate items. Keep upholstery off the floor. Most
            lightweight chairs can be stacked “seat to seat” or placed upside
            down on tables, which cannot be disassembled. Finally, place a light
            cotton dust cover, such as a bed sheet, over your furniture.
        - question: Books and Documents
          answer: >
            Pack books flat to protect the spines. Do not place boxes directly
            on concrete floors, but use pallets or skids to prevent moisture
            absorption. Use packing to fill all empty pockets in each box. Do
            not pack fragile items in the same box with books and do not
            overload.
        - question: Holiday Decorations
          answer: >
            Save the original cartons that contained delicate ornaments. Pad the
            ornaments with packing paper or newsprint. Wrap strings of lights
            around a piece of cardboard before placing in a carton lined with
            packing paper.
        - question: Mirrors, Windows, Glass Sheeting and Screens
          answer: >
            These items should be stored on edges, not flat. We offer a
            selection of mirror/picture boxes that can be purchased at our
            office.
        - question: Tools
          answer: >
            Metal tools should be cleaned and wiped with a rag containing a few
            drops of machine oil to prevent rust. Long handled tools such as
            rakes, shovels and hoes should be clean, lightly oiled and tied in
            bundles.
        - question: Bicycles and Other Metal Items
          answer: >
            To avoid rust, wipe all metal surfaces with a rag containing a few
            drops of machine oil.
        - question: Mark Your Calendar
          answer: >
            Make a timeline leading up to moving day for cleaning out, labeling,
            and organizing your life before you move. Take a little time each
            week or day to check off the list, one room or closet at a time.
        - question: Don't Rush
          answer: >
            Taking time to carefully load your storage space will ensure the
            best results for your belongings.
        - question: Leave Some Room
          answer: >
            Leave air space around the perimeter to aid ventilation. Boxes of
            the same size make for easy stacking.
        - question: Clear a Path
          answer: >
            Leave a walkway to the rear of your space for convenient access to
            all items.
        - question: Think Outside of the Box
          answer: >
            Using plastic storage containers is a great option for accessibility
            without the hassle of packing tape.
        - question: Use Quality Materials
          answer: >
            Use high-quality packing boxes designed especially for the job and
            seal them completely with packing tape.
        - question: Make a List and Plan Ahead
          answer: >
            Create a list of labeled boxes for easy reference. Color
            coordinating or numbering each box is a great trick to stay
            organized.


            Also, gather up plenty of sturdy, corrugated cartons, packing paper,
            bubble wrap, sealing tape and marker pens, along with any furniture
            covers or shelving you intend to use in your storage unit.
        - question: Keep, Give, Trash
          answer: >
            A month before you move is a great time to clean house. Plan a trip
            to your local donation center with old clothes, toys or sporting
            equipment, garage and lawn gear. If something is broken, expired, or
            no longer of use, lighten your load and throw away what you won’t be
            taking with you.
        - question: Pack Efficiently
          answer: >
            Pack as much as you can in the same size boxes. Fill boxes tightly,
            but take care to neither overpack nor underpack. (Bulging cartons
            tip when stacked, while half full boxes tend to collapse). Use
            wadded up newsprint, bubblewrap, rags, towels, or blankets to fill
            in empty spaces. For maximum protection seal cartons with tape.
        - question: Manage Weight
          answer: >
            Pack heavy items such as books and tools in small boxes. For easier
            handling limit the weight of all cartons, regardless of size, to 30
            lbs. or less.
        - question: Label All Boxes
          answer: >
            Clearly label boxes so you know their contents, and keep a list (as
            well as pictures and descriptions) at your home or office for
            reference. Mark clearly all boxes containing fragile items.
        - question: Clean Stored Items
          answer: >
            Clean and dry appliances before storing. Secure all movable parts
            with paper, or wedge and wrap a paper pad around each item for
            protection. During transport tape all doors shut, but remember to
            wedge them open for storage.
        - question: Placement
          answer: >
            Store items you’ll need most often at the front of the unit. When
            you pack your storage unit, create a center aisle for access to all
            items.
        - question: Preparation Prior to Your Move
          answer: |
            - Buy packing supplies&nbsp;
            - Start packing boxes as soon as possible&nbsp;
            - Send address change cards&nbsp;
            - Get copy of school records&nbsp;
            - Have clothing dry cleaned&nbsp;
            - Check on items in repair shops&nbsp;
            - Notify utilities and telephone companies&nbsp;
            - Set a date for utility disconnection and hookup&nbsp;
            - Return borrowed items and things you’ve lent out
        - question: Use Drawers
          answer: >
            Use bureau drawers to store small, fragile items. Secure items in
            drawer by filling empty spaces with towels or packing paper.
        - question: Cover Chairs
          answer: >
            Protect chair legs by wrapping them in packing paper. Leave
            slipcovers on upholstered chairs and cover them with plastic chair
            covers.
        - question: Use Paper for Breakables
          answer: >
            Use lots of paper to pack dishes and glassware. Place a layer of
            packing paper inside the bottom and top of cartons. Wrap each dish
            and glass separately and cushion them with crumpled paper. Plates
            are best stacked on edge. Pad mirrors and paintings with paper.
            Place them in special mirror packs or large boxes; mark boxes.
        - question: Separate Lamps and Lampshades
          answer: >
            Wrap large lamp bases in padding and wrap smaller lamps completely
            before placing them in boxes. Pack delicate lamp shades separately.
            Do not use newsprint to wrap lamp shades or any other goods that may
            be damaged by ink stains. You can purchase unprinted wrapping paper,
            foam wrap or bubble wrap at our location to help protect delicate
            items. Do not store heavy items on top of cartons containing lamps
            or lampshades.
        - question: Don't Put Boxes on the Floor
          answer: >
            Do not place boxes directly on concrete floors, but use pallets or
            skids to prevent moisture absorption.
        - question: Moving Day!
          answer: >
            - Discard all flammables, such as paint and gasoline

            - Finish packing. Leave out items for moving day

            - Empty and defrost refrigerator and freezer

            - Have everything packed, except bedding

            - Pick up ice and beverages

            - Strip beds. Cover mattresses with mattress bags unless they are
            going in storage

            - Turn water and lights off

            - Lock windows and doors
