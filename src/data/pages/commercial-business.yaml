      faqs:
        - question: Is Portable Storage for me?
          answer: >
            Renovating or selling your home? Do you need space for a
            restoration? Maybe you are downsizing and want to keep certain
            items? These are just a few ways Easy Mobile Storage can help your
            self-storage needs. Onsite contractor storage, small business
            storage, remodel/ remediation storage, and special event storage are
            all excellent ways to use our containers for extra space.
        - question: What fits in an 8' x 16' Box Protect Box Container?
          answer: >
            You can ideally fill 3-4 rooms or a 1 bedroom apartment into our Box
            Protect Box 8’ x 16’ container.
        - question: How Long Can I Keep the Container at My House?
          answer: >
            Once we drop your container off, you can take your time packing it
            up. Unlike rental trucks, there won't be any kind of rush to load
            your storage container. So, take a week, a month, or however long
            you need. We won't mind.
        - question: How soon can a container be delivered?
          answer: >
            We try to have your storage container delivered within 24-48 hours
            or schedule a delivery date that works best for you.
        - question: How Does Pricing Work?
          answer: >
            There is a monthly rental fee with your&nbsp;Box
            Protect&nbsp;container, which bills monthly on the date your
            container is delivered.&nbsp;
