Make sure that stoves and cooking equipment are clean and dry before you pack them.\n",{question:715,answer:716},"Dishes and Glassware","Place a layer of packing inside the bottom and the top of boxes containing glassware.

Again, fill all open pockets with packing paper. Label all boxes containing glassware and do not place heavy items on top.\n",{question:718,answer:719},"Furniture","Place a pallet, corrugated cardboard mat, or plastic sheet on the floor before placing furniture. If possible, stand sofas and mattresses on end. Disassemble beds and tables and wrap table legs in paper. If a table will not disassemble, place padding on the floor and place the table on its top with the legs pointing up. Use dresser tops for stacking cartons and dresser drawers for linens or small, delicate items. Keep upholstery off the floor.

If something is broken, expired, or no longer of use, lighten your load and throw away what you won’t be taking with you.\n",{question:760,answer:761},"Pack Efficiently","Pack as much as you can in the same size boxes. Fill boxes tightly, but take care to neither overpack nor underpack. (Bulging cartons tip when stacked, while half full boxes tend to collapse). Use wadded up newsprint, bubblewrap, rags, towels, or blankets to fill in empty spaces. For maximum protection seal cartons with tape.\n",{question:763,answer:764},"Manage Weight","Pack heavy items such as books and tools in small boxes. For easier handling limit the weight of all cartons, regardless of size, to 30 lbs. or less.\n",{question:766,answer:767},"Label All Boxes","Clearly label boxes so you know their contents, and keep a list (as well as pictures and descriptions) at your home or office for reference. Mark clearly all boxes containing fragile items.\n",{question:769,answer:770},"Clean Stored Items","Clean and dry appliances before storing.

Pad mirrors and paintings with paper. Place them in special mirror packs or large boxes; mark boxes.\n",{question:787,answer:788},"Separate Lamps and Lampshades","Wrap large lamp bases in padding and wrap smaller lamps completely before placing them in boxes. Pack delicate lamp shades separately. Do not use newsprint to wrap lamp shades or any other goods that may be damaged by ink stains.
